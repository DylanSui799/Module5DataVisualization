Analysis
1. Overview of Data Statistics:

The summary statistics table reveals insights into tumor volume distribution for different drug regimens.
Capomulin and Ramicane show the lowest mean and median tumor volumes, indicating potential efficacy in reducing tumor sizes.
These regimens also exhibit the lowest standard error of the mean (SEM), suggesting more precise and reliable estimates.
2. Analysis of Tumor Volume Distribution:

A boxplot illustrates final tumor volume distribution for Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
Capomulin and Ramicane display lower median final tumor volumes and narrower interquartile ranges.
This implies a more consistent and potentially effective treatment compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin.
Outlier analysis highlights potential outliers in the Infubinol regimen, indicating variability in treatment response within this group.
3. Evaluation of Correlation and Regression:

The scatter plot and linear regression analysis for mouse weight versus average tumor volume under Capomulin show a positive correlation.
As mouse weight increases, there is a tendency for average tumor volume to increase, supported by the regression line.
The correlation coefficient of approximately 0.84 strengthens evidence of a direct relationship between mouse weight and observed tumor volume in response to the Capomulin regimen.
